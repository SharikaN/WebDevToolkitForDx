# Building the packages
This information is only needed if you are updating source for this toolkit.

To create the release zip in the `build` directory:

```
$ npm run grunt build
```

When you are releasing copy the zip to the release directory


## Note regarding dxsync
The dxsync uses pre-compiled `pathwatcher/pathwatcher-8.1.0.tgz` for Node.js 12.

The tarball is generated by running `node pathwatcher/patch.js 8.1.0`

## File Watching
In the dashboard, separate processes are spawned for watching files (to avoid
using the same processes as the UI of the dashboard). The code for those processes
can be found under `digexp-dashboard/js/ch_processes/`. STDIN and STDOUT are
used for IPC due to issues with node-channels on windows. However, in retrospect,
there are more robust options (such as TCP sockets).
